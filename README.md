This repository consist of three projects:  
1. Virtual Camera:  
    This project shows how to draw 3D objects in 2D coordinate system.  
2. Object Covering:  
    This project shows clipping shapes using painter's algorithm.  
3. Light Simulator:   
    This project simulates ligth reflections. I used Phong shading algorithm.
    I based this project on witek1902 [repository](https://github.com/witek1902/lighting-visualisation)
